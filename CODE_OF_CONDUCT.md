# Code of Conduct

This project adheres to the
[Contributor Covenant 2.1](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/).
We expect all interactions to follow the standards of respect, collaboration, and
empathy outlined in the original document.

## Our Commitment

- Contribute to an open and welcoming community, regardless of age, background,
  identity, or experience.
- Promote a safe environment free from harassment, discrimination, or personal
  attacks.
- Provide and receive constructive feedback, focusing on the problem, not the
  individual.

## Scope

This code applies to all project-related spaces:

- GitHub repositories (Issues, Discussions, PRs, comments).
- Official chat channels and social media.
- Events, streams, or in-person and virtual meetups organized by the
  maintainers.

## Incident Reporting

- Follow the contact instructions described in **[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)**
  or send a direct email to
  **[jp.coutm@gmail.com](mailto:jp.coutm@gmail.com)** with the subject line
  `CODE OF CONDUCT`.
- Report what happened, the approximate date and time, the participants
  involved, and any available evidence (logs, screenshots). Your information
  will be kept confidential.

## Actions

Depending on the severity and history, maintainers may:

- Issue a verbal or written warning.
- Request a public or private apology.
- Remove comments or close discussions.
- Apply temporary timeouts or permanent bans from project spaces.
- Report the incident to the platform (e.g., GitHub) or appropriate authorities,
  if necessary.

Decisions are made in good faith and may consider contribution history,
severity, risk to the community, and local legislation.
